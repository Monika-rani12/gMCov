#gProf: A gCov based new profiler for MC/DC and SC-MCC

gProf is a generalized tool that can be plugged with any test case generator. It requires a set of test cases and a program to produce score%(MC/DC or SC-MCC) with a detailed report.

Currently in this version, there are five primary directories:

Test Case Generators(CBMC and AFL); these are responsible for producing the test suite for a given input C program(The related code is in CBMC/. and afl-2.52b/. respectively)

Sequence Generator; this is used to generate the SC-MCC sequences for a given input C program(GCOV version). The related code is in SequenceGenerator/.

Instrumentation Component; this instruments the C program with the SC-MCC sequences. The related code is in SequenceGenerator/.

GCOV Profiler; this generates feasible sequences report upon inputing instrumented C program along with the test suite. The related code is in main-gProfiler.sh

Analyzer; this takes the report generated by gCov, and the sequences information as input and generates score%(MC/DC or SC-MCC). The related code is in main-gProfiler.sh

Additionally, the programs in both CBMC and GCOV versions are stored in the Programs/. And, all the generated results are available in gSC-MCC_Results/. And the run-gprofiler.sh file contains the commands to execute all the 30 RERS programs.
